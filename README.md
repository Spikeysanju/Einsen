## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

<details open> <summary> When was project Einsen started? </summary>  

> 🎯 Productivity Mental Models I actually I started working on this idea 6 months before founding `Einsen app` (April 2021). The idea was exploring `mental models` + `productivity tips` to achieve your `goals`. I tried to test the idea with `Productivity` & `Time Management Trackers` . So I built `initial MVP`..

</details>

<details> <summary> Where can I find the research process for Einsen app?</summary>  

> The biggest lesson I learned while designing this was that, I need to be `focused` & `working relentlessly` on the same project, to get the right flow of thought & complete it. Each `iteration` led to more `insights` on improving the design, `solving problems` for users. You can find the link for design process [here](url)
